For example, to the right the outcropping just left\r\nof the road.\r\n\r\nWhat we need to do in terms of a working field geologist 'what do I need to figure out\"\r\nwe know we have an extensive prominent flow unit we can trace.  But we have smaller out\r\ncroppings which is something else which is probably volcanic.  We need to see if we can\r\ndetermine the age relationships between the outcroppings and this prominent flow.\r\n\r\nTwo things to show:\r\n1. that this flow is continuous with this cone.  You can see no break\r\nbetween the rock types in the flow and in this cone.  This was not obvious from the map.\r\n(I thought it was not the case).\r\n\r\n2. A good aerial of the extent of the flow unit.  you may be able to trace\r\nthe boundary of the flow unit as well as we know based on what is uncovered.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is more description, links to more of these images, and maps, at http://scaleindependent.com/projects/drats","snapshot_set":null,"tag_set":["d-rats-2010 drats_rich"],"embeddable":false,"taken":"2010-04-05 00:00:00","updated":"2015-01-08 09:03:02","width":68026.0,"owner":{"username":"Rich","id":353,"last_name":"Gibson","first_name":"Rich"}}],[116633,{"printable":false,"name":"Close up on northern flank of SP Crater (G1)","gigapixels":1.30363,"location":{"latitude":35.587215,"altitude":2.0,"datum":"WGS84","longitude":-111.634926},"comment_set":null,"uploaded":"2012-10-15 18:01:35","id":116633,"views":443,"explore_score":1.0,"projection":{"type":"spherical","distance":15.0,"field_of_view":{"height":null,"base":0.0,"width":156.656}},"height":26005.0,"orientation":{"roll":0.0,"heading":175.0,"datum":"WGS84","tilt":90.0},"levels":9,"description":"Note surface pattern of cracking on the rocks.
