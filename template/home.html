I have taken gigapans in nine states. Hawaii, Washington, Oregon, California, Nevada, Arizona, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and New York.
And in five Countries. The USA, Great Britain, The Netherlands, Germany, and Austria.

Notes: I want geo django, and probably spatialite for sqlite3, (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/gis/install/)
but it seems easier for now to do the simplest least useless thing

why doesn't add_tag.py find gigapans, the same code works within a view :-(
python ./add_tag.py --oldtag=vienna --newtag wien | more
hmmm...make it a view?

            I create multi-image hi resolution images at different scales. From sub micron resolution to 300 megapixel portraits of people, and on to infinity and beyond :-) I also write software (<a href="https://github.com/RichGibson">my GitHub account</a>), fabricate equipment, including a CNC controlled microscope, once wr0te books (<a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596007034.do">Mapping Hacks</a>), and passionately evangelize for the technologies and tools I love.

            I am available for Gigapan and Portrait photography, events, archival work, and programming. Please contact me <a href="mailto:rich.gibson@gmail.com">Rich.Gibson@gmail.com</a>.<p>

                Aug 9, 2012 Gene Cooper and I showed Gigapixel Science in the SIGGRAPH Studio. I took high resolution portraits, many of which are now processed and up on the <a href="http://gigapan.com/gigapans?order=most_recent&query=siggraph_studio_2012">GigaPan site.</a> If we chatted about anything, please drop me a line! And if I took your protrait but it is not yet up give me a week to process images, but then _please_ contact me - if it is not processed within a week I may need a reminder to help me to find it!
<p>
Gene and I also gave a SIGGRAPH Studio talk. Here is an <a href="http://scaleindependent.com/presentations/siggraph_2012.index.html">HTML view of the slides.</a>

And here is what I did with gigapanning in the cold.  Well, not really cold.
