<h2>Load Gigapans</h2>

<ul>
	<li>(edit load_gigapans.py to set the username)
	<li>python ./load_gigapans.py
	<li>python ./get_json.py
	<li>python ./load_json.py
	<li>(thumbnails)
</ul>

load_gigapans to get the gigapan_id's, then get_json.py to get full json, and 
load_json to load data from the json?
Trying to deal with different names and fields between the old api, which
gives you the ability to get all of the gigapans for a person, and the .json
files, which have data I want, but also data which is missing? tags?


<ul>

Docs: put a file in template/docs. Then it appears in the list. Fundamental rule, every
website turns into a CMS.

wrote and had forgotten..

‎"What an astonishing thing a book is. It’s a flat object made from a tree with flexible parts on which are imprinted lots of funny dark squiggles. But one glance at it and you’re inside the mind of another person, maybe somebody dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, an author is speaking clearly and silently inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhaps the greatest of human inventions, binding together people who never knew each other, citizens of distant epochs. Books break the shackles of time. A book is proof that humans are capable of working magic." (Carl Sagan; Cosmos)
