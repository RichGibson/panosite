Tasks:
-multiple bytag tags don't work :-( bme core includes paige , bme works, core works. ie. multiple tags return a union not an intersection
-implement tags in the model
-implement tag search, pass a hash to the gigapans method.
-replicate relavent functionality of gigapan site

I could make a location 'app' modeling taggit, and add a location to (some) tags.


Current issues:
-parsing gigapans only loads 60...answer: the api only returns 60 gigapans per page.
looks like my json downloaded file only has 60 gigapans? WTF?
It maxes out at 60 per page.

The gigapan API
Fetch my most recent 1000 of my gigapans
 curl -o my_gigapans.json http://api.gigapan.org/beta/gigapans/page/1/per_page/1000/username/rich/most_recent.json?callback=process_json


Installation:
pip install django-taggit

Goal: upload bm2009 images, and get a geocoded copy.

tags: 
These three tags are non-intersecting.
bm2009
bme2009
bme_2009
