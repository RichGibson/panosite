How has my esthetic changed over time? Can I quantify the uncountable?

Jay and I are looking at actual stats of my aspect ratios...these are numbers and graphs which are 
attempting to explore my esthetic, as evidenced by my choices of subjects and aspect ratios.

There are real variations.

For example, figure: rich_gigapan_aspect_ratio01.eps
This is a histogram of gigapans, where the aspect ratio is less than 5:1, aspect ratio along
the x axis, number of gigapans in that aspect ratio 'bucket' on y.
There is a whole and then a spike...what does it mean :-)

Do my preferred aspect ratios vary with time?



rich_gigapan_aspect_ratio02.eps
shows aspect ratios sorted, against an arbitrary gigapan count. Where the line is vertical I took no
gigapans in that aspect ratio range.

what is there about the aspect ratio 1.9:1 that I took no gigapans?

Quantifying my artistic taste.

graph 3, aspect ratio compared with gigapan experience.

Did I pick different aspect ratios over time as I learned more? Did I respond to the tools with changes
in creative choices?

the first graphs had the earliest and latest gigapans reversed - so early was to the right, not applicaple for the histograms...

graph4 aspect ration compared with gigapan experience with lines - the right, more recent, gigapans are more square, mapping to my 
experience of doing portraits and more square images of CORE art.

thought: how unique is width and height? can I use them to fingerprint an image?
